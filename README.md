Ansible Linux TV repository


update, wont push properlly

Finally got it to work seems the tutorial is wrong again, this initial clone is.

git clone ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/reevan01/ansible.git 
git status 
git add README.md 
git commit -m "updated readme file" 
git push origin main 

or just 
git push

the first and last are different from the tutorial.
